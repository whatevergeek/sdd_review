# Feature Comparison AI Discussion Transcript

**AI-Driven Feature Analysis of Spec-Driven Development Frameworks**

*A collaborative discussion between multiple AI agents analyzing detailed features of BMAD Method, OpenSpec, Spec-Kit, and AI-DLC*

---

## Initial Request

**Paul:** I want to have a new document called: feature_comparison.md
This will be a detailed list of features from all 4 frameworks.

Study all 4 frameworks and retrieve their list of features. Such features will be used for comparison later.
You can find the various frameworks in the shared folders:
BMAD-METHOD - BMAD 
OpenSpec - OpenSpec 
spec-kit - Spec Kit
aidlc-workflows - AI DLC

brainstorm and come up with a list of features.
for example, for multi-agent orchestration feature, it's called *party-mode in BMAD. Other frameworks might have a different name for it. For each generic feature name, find out the corresponding name in the framework as you need to list its corresponding table column.

under the feature name of the framework, specify if the framework supports it and how it compares/differs with other framework approaches/implementation.
feature_comparison.md Create a table with the following header:| Feature | BMAD Method | OpenSpec | Spec-Kit | AI-DLC |

Place the document in the doc folder.
Refer to other markdown documents in the doc folder for format/style inspiration.
