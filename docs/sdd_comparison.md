## Introduction

The software development industry is experiencing a paradigm shift. Traditional code-first approaches are giving way to specification-driven methodologies that leverage artificial intelligence to bridge the gap between intent and implementation. This transformation addresses long-standing challenges in software development: maintaining alignment between requirements and code, managing complexity at scale, and accelerating delivery without sacrificing quality.

Four distinct approaches have emerged as leaders in this space, each with unique philosophies and implementations:

1. **BMAD Method** - Comprehensive agile development with AI agents
2. **OpenSpec** - Lightweight change-driven specification management
3. **Spec-Kit** - Constitutional development with quality gates
4. **AI-DLC** - AI-native development lifecycle methodology

This analysis provides decision-makers with the insights needed to select the approach that best fits their organizational context, technical requirements, and development culture.

    D --> D1[Constitutional principles<br/>Test-driven development<br/>Library-first architecture]
    E --> E1[AI-initiated conversations<br/>Domain-driven design<br/>Continuous validation]
```

**BMAD Method** adopts a comprehensive agent-orchestrated approach where specialized AI agents collaborate across the entire development lifecycle. It emphasizes scale-adaptive workflows that automatically adjust complexity based on project requirements.

**OpenSpec** focuses on change-driven specification management, treating specifications as living documents that evolve through explicit change proposals. It maintains a clear separation between current state (specs) and proposed changes.

**Spec-Kit** implements a constitutional approach with immutable development principles that govern all generated code. It emphasizes quality gates and test-driven development as core methodology components.

**AI-DLC** pioneers an AI-native approach where AI initiates and directs conversations with humans, reversing traditional interaction patterns. It integrates domain-driven design principles directly into the core methodology.
