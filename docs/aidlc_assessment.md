## Overall Assessment

**Total Score: 7.8/10**

AI-DLC represents the most forward-thinking and AI-native approach to specification-driven development currently available. Its revolutionary philosophy of AI-initiated conversations and integration of domain-driven design principles position it at the cutting edge of software development methodology. However, its paradigm-shifting nature and limited ecosystem make it suitable primarily for organizations ready to embrace significant change.

The methodology's strength lies in its comprehensive reimagining of the development process around AI capabilities rather than retrofitting AI into existing approaches. This makes it particularly valuable for organizations building complex, domain-rich systems and willing to invest in learning new development paradigms.
