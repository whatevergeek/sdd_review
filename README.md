# Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Comparative Analysis

A comprehensive research project analyzing four leading approaches to specification-driven development: BMAD Method, OpenSpec, Spec-Kit, and AI-DLC.

## 📋 Repository Overview

This repository contains a detailed comparative analysis of spec-driven development methodologies, conducted through multi-agent AI collaboration. The research evaluates each approach across strategic, technical, and user experience dimensions to provide decision-makers with actionable insights.

## 📊 Executive Summary

Spec-driven development represents a fundamental shift where specifications become executable artifacts that drive implementation. This analysis reveals four distinct approaches:
